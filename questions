1. In your own words, define closure (1-2 sentences).

a function nested inside of a function. 
   
2. Study the following code, then answer the questions below.

```js
function personalDice(name){
  return function(){
      // generate random number between 1 and 6
    const newRoll = Math.floor(Math.random() * 6);
    console.log(`${name} rolled a ${newRoll}`)
  }
}

const dansRoll = personalDice("Dan");

const zoesRoll = personalDice("Zoe");


dansRoll();
dansRoll();
```

a. Where is closure used in this code? How can you tell?

function personalDice is defined and is returning another 
function that generates the number 

b. Compare and contrast calling `dansRoll` the first and second time. 
What is always the same? What could change?

the variable is defined as const so it wouldnt change.

c. What is the lexical scope of `newRoll`? 
function scope of personalDice.
